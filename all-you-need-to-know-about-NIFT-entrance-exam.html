There are two stages in which the written exam is conducted (the number of rounds changes for different programs offered in NIFT). Please refer  <b>NIFT Exam Pattern 2024</b> section for more information. </p>
                                                    <p><b>Is the NIFT exam difficult to crack? </b></p>
                                                    <p>
                                                    On the surface of it, the NIFT entrance exam seems difficult to crack. With a limited number of seats and reservations, with approximately 40,000 students appearing in All India, securing admission to this prestigious institution – “PRIMA FACIE” looks tough.  But looks can be deceiving provided you were to shed your perception and look into reality. For one, like all All India Examination one needs a definitive interest, drive, willpower, resilience, and a meticulous amount of preparation in cracking this exam.  The key to this situation is to practice a lot and follow a timetable. For example, for candidates preparing by themselves, it’s to be noted that you start with your difficult areas in terms of question paper and work your way upwards. For students who depend on a coaching center please ensure that you provision time post your training sessions at home for practice. </p>
                                                    <p><b>How can I start preparing for the NIFT examination?</b></p>
                                                    <p>A good way to begin will be to start with the previous year's question papers. This will help in understanding the topics covered and the syllabus. You can download the previous year NIFT exam question papers with answers, which will help in familiarizing on the pattern of questions and level of toughness. </p>
                                                    <p>Look at the weightage of the scores between the CAT & GAT. Mostly students face difficulty in the drawing part. For example, memory drawing, compositions etc. I would suggest you to start with basic line drawing and improve confidence in lines. </p>
                                                    <p>Second thing is to understand the various shapes. Try connecting shapes with objects. Do not focus on the speed in which you complete, that will come with practice. But the emphasis here is to practice vigorously. Once you are done with the basics practice compositions with right ratios and proportions. Ensure that you do evaluate your sketches with someone who has had the experience of clearing the examination.</p>
                                                    <p>For the theory part practice maximum question papers. Compare your answers with the answer bank available. Focus on the topic that you find difficult. A must for every student is to start reading newspaper on a regular basis, refer online platforms on latest happening in the world of fashion and familiarise yourself with brands, logos and slogans. Having a copy of Manorama Year book should help you to a large extent towards improving your knowledge in GK & General Awareness.</p>
